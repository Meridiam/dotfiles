Jul 28 13:53:42 <aer>	i installed a bunch of packages from a user repository and couldnt be bothered to check the source code
Jul 28 13:53:51 <aer>	now im slightly worried
Jul 28 13:54:31 <mitya>	Which?
Jul 28 13:54:35 <aer>	aur
Jul 28 13:56:19 <mitya>	AUR is normally pretty reliable
Jul 28 13:56:23 <mitya>	What package

Jul 28 13:56:39 <aer>	a lot

Jul 28 14:48:37 <thirteenthspiral>	Hiya
Jul 28 14:48:48 <mitya>	How's it going
Jul 28 14:49:09 <thirteenthspiral>	Alright. Been lazing around these past couple days. You?
Jul 28 14:49:59 <mitya>	Alright. I've been working all summer preparing for my move next week
Jul 28 14:50:39 <thirteenthspiral>	Oh nice
Jul 28 14:51:41 <mitya>	Yeah, I've got a long drive ahead of me
Jul 28 14:55:16 <thirteenthspiral>	How far?
Jul 28 14:55:36 <mitya>	Uh I think 1400 miles
Jul 28 14:55:44 <mitya>	Florida to Connecticut

Jul 28 15:08:00 <aer>	went through source for 5 packages, didn't find anything suspicious, so just set up firestarter (ironically also an AUR package) as a firewall solution 
Jul 28 15:08:03 <sidolino>	hi
Jul 28 15:09:47 <aer>	@mitya tbh all the packages i installed were relatively well-maintained and widely used so it's probably overkill at that
Jul 28 15:10:22 <mitya>	Sounds like it but if it makes you feel better then no loss
Jul 28 15:11:03 <aer>	still have this problem where after i suspend to ram i can't get back into the environment though
Jul 28 15:12:08 <mitya>	That's a somewhat common issue people have though
Jul 28 15:12:13 <aer>	really?
Jul 28 15:12:20 <mitya>	Weird behavior after suspend
Jul 28 15:12:44 <aer>	but then what do people who use linux on their laptops do 
Jul 28 15:13:49 <aer>	im guessing the solution is to just not suspend when closing the lid, but it helps conserve battery
Jul 28 15:13:50 <mitya>	Do you use dpms
Jul 28 15:13:54 <aer>	dpms?
Jul 28 15:14:14 <mitya>	Display power management signaling
Jul 28 15:14:16 <thirteenthspiral>	That's a long drive wow. Sorry for late response
Jul 28 15:14:20 <mitya>	No problem
Jul 28 15:15:06 <aer>	i don't use dpms
Jul 28 15:15:18 <aer>	so the screen just turns off after a while
Jul 28 15:15:27 <mitya>	And doesn't turn back on
Jul 28 15:15:33 <aer>	it does
Jul 28 15:15:37 <aer>	just when i close the lid
Jul 28 15:15:38 <mitya>	Oh
Jul 28 15:15:39 <aer>	it suspends to ram
Jul 28 15:15:47 <mitya>	Do you know what controls that
Jul 28 15:15:48 <aer>	i can disable that but i like saving power
Jul 28 15:16:08 <aer>	i saw a forum post about it an hour ago, ill go and check
Jul 28 15:16:46 <aer>	ok so it's a systemd config file
Jul 28 15:16:49 <thirteenthspiral>	Does anyone know what the results of the poll was? I can't tell if the current results are real or not, since it's been over a week since it actually closed.
Jul 28 15:17:03 <aer>	didnt it close on the 27th
Jul 28 15:17:23 <aer>	"HandleLidSwitch=ignore"
Jul 28 15:17:50 <aer>	in /etc/systemd/logind.conf
Jul 28 15:18:14 <thirteenthspiral>	I thought it said the 20th- oh misread it. The 25th
Jul 28 15:18:18 <aer>	i just wish there was a way to make suspend work properly 
Jul 28 15:18:40 <thirteenthspiral>	Still a few days. Is Inou-Battle most likely one of the winners then?
Jul 28 15:18:42 <aer>	looks like musaigen topped the polls
Jul 28 15:19:34 <mitya>	Using dpms was favorable for me before.
Jul 28 15:19:50 <mitya>	But it made my headphones' sound not work on return
Jul 28 15:20:05 <aer>	does it handle recovering from suspend?
Jul 28 15:20:16 <aer>	meh thats not that big of a deal for me
Jul 28 15:21:39 <thirteenthspiral>	I was disappointed that there was never a second season of Inou-Battle. It was so good by the end.
Jul 28 15:21:52 <thirteenthspiral>	Same with Grimgar.

Jul 28 15:29:59 <thirteenthspiral>	I forgot the dubbed version had a different one.

Jul 28 15:31:19 <thirteenthspiral>	I'm sorry, I'm new :'(
Jul 28 15:31:46 <aer>	it's okay, just tell mitya to send you a list of the most influential anime
Jul 28 15:32:06 <aer>	watch those and you'll fit right in

Jul 28 15:33:02 <aer>	yes 
Jul 28 15:33:04 <mitya>	Uh
Jul 28 15:33:15 <mitya>	I watched some things last season
Jul 28 15:33:20 <mitya>	Kiznaiver was super emotional
Jul 28 15:33:42 <thirteenthspiral>	I liked that a lot too.
Jul 28 15:33:44 <mitya>	Kabaneri no Koutetsujou was good fighting but weak plot ( I still mostly enjoyed it)
Jul 28 15:33:51 <thirteenthspiral>	Ending was a bit meh
Jul 28 15:34:13 <mitya>	Netoge no yome..... Was really cute and nostalgic for a former mmo player
Jul 28 15:34:32 <thirteenthspiral>	Is that the one with the "I hate normies" girl
Jul 28 15:34:38 <mitya>	Yes
Jul 28 15:34:40 <mitya>	Ako best girl
Jul 28 15:34:45 <thirteenthspiral>	I couldn't get into it sadly
Jul 28 15:35:07 <mitya>	Big Order was alright. If you liked mirai nikki you might like it
Jul 28 15:35:17 <mitya>	Same author
Jul 28 15:35:23 <thirteenthspiral>	Big Order I dropped after the sister/father fight episode
Jul 28 15:35:37 <mitya>	There were several notable SoL anime last season
Jul 28 15:35:44 <mitya>	Not my thing tho
Jul 28 15:35:49 <thirteenthspiral>	Joker Game was pretty nice. I still need to watch the last couple episodes.
Jul 28 15:36:05 <mitya>	Re:Zero prob one of the best
Jul 28 15:36:08 <mitya>	Still ongoing tho
Jul 28 15:36:17 <thirteenthspiral>	I agree.
Jul 28 15:36:23 <mitya>	This season there's s4 prisma illya
Jul 28 15:36:25 <thirteenthspiral>	Have you seen Rakugo?
Jul 28 15:36:37 <mitya>	And D. gray-man gets something again finally
Jul 28 15:36:45 <thirteenthspiral>	I never read/watched Fate.
Jul 28 15:36:46 <mitya>	I have so much nostalgia with that series
Jul 28 15:36:53 <mitya>	Fate is really good imo
Jul 28 15:37:04 <thirteenthspiral>	Yeah, I finally am watching the series. I tried to a long time ago but couldn't (D. Gray-man)
Jul 28 15:37:29 <thirteenthspiral>	I really hope the new series has really good animation.
Jul 28 15:38:03 <mitya>	Which?

Jul 28 15:38:42 <thirteenthspiral>	No? Did you see Bungo Stray Dogs last season?
Jul 28 15:38:43 <mitya>	And coding a bit too
Jul 28 15:38:59 <mitya>	I didn't watch it but I heard it was really gay
Jul 28 15:39:02 <mitya>	Literally
Jul 28 15:39:07 <thirteenthspiral>	What? Not even.
Jul 28 15:39:21 <thirteenthspiral>	It was one of the best series that season.
Jul 28 15:40:51 <mitya>	I didn't like the look of the art so I didn't bother
Jul 28 15:41:03 <thirteenthspiral>	You should try it out honestly.
Jul 28 15:41:39 <thirteenthspiral>	It's not like Free, if that's what you are worried about. It's more shounen than shounen ai.
Jul 28 15:42:02 <thirteenthspiral>	And it's not like an otome either.

Aug 02 21:48:18 <mitya>	Oh ic
Aug 02 21:49:49 <aer>	reason: firefox uses like 4x as much resources as any other process
Aug 02 21:49:52 <mitya>	I was set back a bit by the event of my laptop keyboard getting spilled on and 12 keys stopped working but I ordered a replacement and have been using an external keyboard in the meantime

Aug 02 21:54:32 <aer>	*then
Aug 02 21:54:37 <mitya>	I disabled caching in ff but I don't think that's what makes it not kill my cpu
Aug 02 21:54:47 <aer>	rip
Aug 02 21:55:32 <mitya>	Uh
Aug 02 21:56:09 <aer>	is chromium better than google chrome?

Aug 02 21:56:15 <aer>	besides just being an open source version
Aug 02 21:56:21 <mitya>	Nah they're pretty identical
Aug 02 21:56:27 <hobogunner>	There is a variant of Firefox called Pale Moon
Aug 02 21:56:37 <hobogunner>	if you're pretty set on loving FF but want fewer leaks

Aug 02 21:59:51 <hobogunner>	I just don't get how. That variance almost seems like you need to replace thermal paste

Aug 02 22:00:09 <hobogunner>	>Lenovo ultrabook

Aug 02 22:00:21 <hobogunner>	my laptop should be running hotter than your tho
Aug 02 22:00:22 <aer>	on osx right
Aug 02 22:00:39 <aer>	things run a lot cooler on osx
Aug 02 22:00:42 <mitya>	hm youtube/ff don't seem to make my system freak out too much
Aug 02 22:00:59 <mitya>	even on hd video (not that the difference would be dramatic based on quality)
Aug 02 22:01:02 <aer>	meh ill sacrifice battery life for cpu for now
Aug 02 22:01:10 <hobogunner>	but....why
Aug 02 22:01:14 <aer>	no idea
Aug 02 22:01:17 <hobogunner>	why not both
Aug 02 22:01:30 <kef>	for some reason mangago is using 500 mb smh

Aug 02 22:02:07 <kef>	not just bl
Aug 02 22:02:26 <mitya>	my cpu does work harder than normal when I watch yt
Aug 02 22:02:27 <kef>	i think my chrome uses like 3 gb
Aug 02 22:02:28 <mitya>	but not terribly
Aug 02 22:02:40 <hobogunner>	analyzers that I like make my comp crash
Aug 02 22:02:47 <hobogunner>	but I do force FF to only one core
Aug 02 22:02:55 <mitya>	I don't
Aug 02 22:03:05 <mitya>	I have 4 dual-threaded
Aug 02 22:03:07 <mitya>	I don't see the point
Aug 02 22:03:34 <hobogunner>	Well, we're on different OS' and different systems so....k?
Aug 02 22:03:44 <aer>	wow just ran google chrome and it started a bunch of processes that all use the same amount of resources as firefox
Aug 02 22:04:24 <hobogunner>	I dislike Chrome quite a bit
Aug 02 22:04:36 <hobogunner>	I'd honestly sooner use Edge
Aug 02 22:04:36 <mitya>	chrome used to be better than it is now imo
Aug 02 22:04:41 <hobogunner>	Oh, much
Aug 02 22:05:25 <hobogunner>	I mean, Chrome at least doesn't have FF' issues (at least for me) that require me to switch it to one or two cores only, but still. It is a constantly refreshing (annoyingly) beast
Aug 02 22:07:35 <hobogunner>	Firefox actually handled better previously for me before as well too though, but that could also be because I've used FF since iTunes was green, not blue
Aug 02 22:13:17 *	Wing_ has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Aug 02 22:15:43 <kef>	chat ded why
Aug 02 22:19:30 <mitya>	idk
Aug 02 22:19:50 <mitya>	I'm trying to figure out why my comp says it doesn't have a backlight
Aug 02 22:20:06 <aer>	you mean backlight property?
Aug 02 22:20:13 <mitya>	yeah
Aug 02 22:20:21 <aer>	same thing happened to me
Aug 02 22:20:30 <aer>	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/light-git
Aug 02 22:20:34 <aer>	just install that
Aug 02 22:20:36 <aer>	works like a charm
Aug 02 22:20:43 <aer>	upstream url ofc lol
Aug 02 22:22:37 <aer>	then bind keys to light -A x%/light -U x%
Aug 02 22:23:15 <mitya>	what a shitty username to type
Aug 02 22:23:19 <mitya>	"haikarainen"
Aug 02 22:23:58 <mitya>	wtf is help2man and why does it depend on that
Aug 02 22:24:26 <mitya>	meh fuck it it's tiny
Aug 02 22:24:31 <aer>	lol
Aug 02 22:26:23 <mitya>	wew
Aug 02 22:26:34 <mitya>	set my brightness to 50% and it worked
Aug 02 22:26:43 <mitya>	xrandr gives fake brightness changes
Aug 02 22:26:53 <aer>	yep
Aug 02 22:26:54 <mitya>	it just messes with the colors
Aug 02 22:27:23 <aer>	its weird how the backlight isn't detected though
Aug 02 22:28:27 <mitya>	it probably has to do with xorg not having a set backlight listed
Aug 02 22:28:28 <mitya>	w/e
Aug 02 22:28:49 <mitya>	messing with the /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness file is just as simple
Aug 02 22:28:59 <mitya>	pretty sure that's what `light` does
Aug 02 22:29:07 <aer>	yeah
Aug 02 22:29:32 <aer>	but light makes things simple :D

Aug 11 21:59:47 <HexOmega>	so fighting games kind of work like this: "game start, footsies (throwing out pokes to bait the opponent), hit connects, execute combo, reset game to footsies"
Aug 11 21:59:59 <HexOmega>	all of the skill is in baiting the opponent 
Aug 11 22:00:14 <Yarn_>	it's like 10% reaction 90% yomi
Aug 11 22:00:18 <HexOmega>	lul
Aug 11 22:00:21 <HexOmega>	5 layers yomi

Aug 11 22:00:32 <aer>	isn't it
Aug 11 22:00:39 <HexOmega>	yea
Aug 11 22:00:42 <Yarn_>	and 5% cheese
Aug 11 22:00:50 <HexOmega>	it's a good bit of mind games and baiting out openings 
Aug 11 22:01:38 <aer>	"knowing the mind of the opponent" lol
Aug 11 22:02:06 <aer>	there's a lot more strategy involved than i expected
